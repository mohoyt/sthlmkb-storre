Större is an easy to build 75% keyboard using only through hole components. It uses a separate microcontroller (like the Pro Micro, Elite C or something RP2040 based) to enable flexibility in firmware and connectivity and to further simplify the soldering experience (no more tricksy USB ports). Demultiplexers and a custom matrix are used to enable the size and features of the board with only the pinouts of a pro micro.
